When someone brings up phone brands made in China, the names that first come to mind are undoubtedly Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo and OnePlus. However, many other Chinese companies also make high-quality smartphones. These Chinese smartphone companies remain obscure since their sales volumes are not high enough in the Chinese market. Nevertheless, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the quality of these companies’ cellphones is not good enough. In fact, these obscure companies’ cells are as saleable as those of Xiaomi and Huawei in some major markets and have released some amazing designs.
