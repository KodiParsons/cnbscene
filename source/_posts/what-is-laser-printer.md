A laser printer is a favorite type of personal computer printer that runs on the non-impression (keys don't strike the paper), photocopier technology. Whenever a document is sent to the printer, a laser beam "draws" the document on a selenium-coated drum applying electrical charges. After the drum is charged, it really is rolled in toner, a dry powder type of ink. The toner adheres to the charged picture on the drum. The toner can be transferred onto a piece of paper and fused to the paper with heat and pressure. Following the file is printed, the electric charge is taken off the drum and the excess toner is collected. Just about all laser printers print simply in monochrome. A color laser beam printer is certainly up to 10 times more costly than a monochrome laser printer.

IBM introduced the initially laser printer in 1975 for use using its mainframe computers. In 1984, Hewlett-Packard revolutionized laser-printing technology with its first LaserJet, a compact, fast, and trustworthy printer that personal computer users could afford. Since that time, laser printers have decreased even more in cost and increased in quality. Hewlett Packard continues to be the leading manufacturer with competitors incorporating Lexmark, Okidata, and Xerox.

The laser printer is different from an inkjet printer in several ways. The toner or ink in a laser beam printer is dry. Within an inkjet, it really is wet. As time passes, an inkjet printer is approximately ten times more costly to operate when compared to a laser printer because ink needs replenishing more frequently. The published paper from an inkjet printer will smear if wet, but a laser-printed document won't. Both types of printer function quietly and allow fonts to come to be added by using font cartridges or putting in delicate fonts. If your printing necessities are nominal, an inkjet printer is enough. If a printing volume is excessive, consider buying a laser printer.

When investing in a laser printer, they are most important features to consider:

-- Print capacity and quickness: Personal laser printers are actually sufficient for printing typically 200 pages weekly. They are low-end and expense $200 and up. They are able to print up to eight ppm (pages each and every minute). A workgroup printer is necessary if typically 1000 pages weekly is needed. These printing up to 24 ppm and cost $1000 to $6000 and more. Development printers are needed for printing 50,000 or even more pages per week. They are quite high-priced and are being used by professional publishers. They are able to print up to 700 ppm and cost $100,000 or more. They can printing 24 hours a day, 7 days per week.
-- Resolution: The typical resolution in most laser beam printers today is 600 dots-per-inch ( dpi ). This image resolution is sufficient for normal every day printing including tiny desktop publishing careers. A high-end development printer might have a resolution of 2400 dpi. Some laser printers still use an answer of 300 dpi. This resolution could cause jagged lines to appear on the outer edge of a graphic. Hewlett Packard created RET (Resolution Improvement Technology) to improve this. RET inserts smaller dots at the edges of lines and to smooth the tough edges. RET will not improve the quality, but the file looks better. If you purchase a printer with 300 dpi, make certain it has RET.
-- Printer languages: Printer Control Vocabulary ( PCL ) may be the standard printer vocabulary for Hewlett Packard and most other laser beam printers (which are actually mostly HP-compatible). PCL is employed for printing letters, data source printouts, spreadsheets, and straightforward design. Postscript printers are being used with desktop publishing application and drawing plans. Postscript printers are the norm for Apple Macintosh printers. A laser beam printer that is included with Postscript installed can be more expensive. A laser printer that uses PCL could be improved to Postscript by putting in a software driver supplied by the maker of the laser printer. The printer might require more recollection when upgraded to employ Postscript. For the reason that a laser beam printer needs the complete image in storage before printing, and a Postscript printer requires more storage to process when compared to a PCL printer will. The application being used must support Postscript in order for the laser beam printer to printing Postscript documents.
-- Paper handling: Paper handling is important when searching for a laser printer. Most laser printers work with letter-size, cut-sheet paper. High-end production printers work with continuous sheet paper. Laser beam printers can printing on transparencies, adhesive labels, and light and portable cards. A laser beam printer with duplex printing can print on one aspect of the paper, flip the paper over, and printing on the other hand. Most laser printers, on the other hand, use straightforward printing with manual duplex printing. Manual duplex printing is normally attained by changing the printing alternatives in the printer's real estate or printing one aspect and spending that same paper and reinserting it in to the printer to printing on the other side.
-- FPOT and warm-up period: A final consideration in purchasing a printer is going to be FPOT (first paper away time) and warm-up time. When a laser beam printer receives info from the computer to print, it requires 5 to 30 seconds to prepare the printer to printing a new job. This is as well as the time it takes to actually print the file. The warm-up period is as significant. When the printer is normally turned on, it requires time to warm-up the fuser to operating temperature. If the printer includes a standby function or is switched off between printing jobs, the warm-up period becomes a lot more important. Significant workgroup and creation printers can take 5 to 15 minutes to warm up. This ready period can hinder overall productivity.
